# Skoll Plugin Runtime Acceptance Log

> Batch: `skoll-plugin-runtime-2026-07-21`
> Append evidence only after the Work Item reaches `Review` and passes independent acceptance.
> Failed acceptance must be recorded before the same Work Item returns to `Doing`.

## PR0-00 Establish Official Plugin Runtime Batch

- Date: 2026-07-21
- Owner: Codex
- Status flow: `Todo -> Doing -> Review -> Done`
- Scope: Create the official parent board, atomic Work Item table, acceptance log, and current document indexes.

### Acceptance Result

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Batch files | Pass | Board, Work Items, and acceptance log exist under `docs/refactor/current/` |
| Atomic structure | Pass | Every Work Item includes priority, Skill, description, dependencies, deliverables, acceptance, verification, and status |
| Milestones | Pass | PR1-PR5 cover runtime, platform services, generator, frontend experience, and independent-industry proof |
| Collaboration | Pass | Task claim, review, failure retry, acceptance, and one-commit rules are explicit |
| Project direction | Pass | The batch forbids compatibility layers, legacy formats, dual paths, and transition adapters |

### Verification Commands

Result: document links, Work Item field/count/status checks, archive boundary check, and `git diff --check` passed.

### Impact Review

- API/OpenAPI: no runtime contract changed.
- Permission/audit: planned as explicit Work Items.
- Migration/seed: planned as explicit Work Items.
- Frontend/i18n: planned as explicit Work Items.
- Documentation: current execution indexes now point to this batch.
- Compatibility: none; current contracts only.

## PR1-01 Execute Declared External Plugin Routes

- Date: 2026-07-21
- Owner: Codex
- Status flow: `Todo -> Doing -> Review -> Done`
- Scope: Replace placeholder route success with declared-route validation and real HTTP execution against `service_base_url`.

### Acceptance Result

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Real execution | Pass | Full Router test reaches an `httptest` plugin backend through the `/skoll` prefix and manifest-declared route |
| Request preservation | Pass | Method, base-path join, declared path, query, body, and ordinary request header assertions pass |
| Response preservation | Pass | Backend HTTP 201, response header, and raw JSON body reach the caller unchanged |
| Fail closed | Pass | Missing backend returns 503, unreachable backend returns 502, disabled plugin returns 503, and missing executor returns 502; no placeholder 200 remains |
| Declaration boundary | Pass | A method/path pair absent from `api.routes` is not executed |
| Contract documentation | Pass | Chinese-default and English plugin API references define `service_base_url`, forwarding behavior, and stable failure codes |
| Quality gates | Pass | Focused tests, race tests, vet, full Go suite, diff check, and CodeGraph sync pass |

### Verification Commands

```powershell
go test ./internal/bootstrap ./internal/handler/http/... ./internal/plugin/... -count=1
go test -race ./internal/bootstrap ./internal/handler/http ./internal/plugin/... -count=1
go vet ./internal/bootstrap ./internal/handler/http/... ./internal/plugin/...
go test ./... -count=1
codegraph sync .
git diff --check
```

Result: all commands passed; CodeGraph synchronized 4 changed Go files.

### Impact Review

- API/OpenAPI: no new path or schema; execution semantics for existing declared plugin routes changed from placeholder success to real backend response.
- Permission/audit: existing JWT, route permission, and audit middleware remain in front of the executor.
- Migration/seed: no impact.
- Frontend/i18n: no client change; stable Chinese-default runtime error messages added.
- Documentation: Chinese and English plugin API contracts updated.
- Compatibility: none; current manifest contracts only.

## PR1-02 Retry Record

| Attempt | Status | Failed Gate | Retry Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Failed | Focused Go packages could not compile because `%TEMP%/go-build*` ran out of disk space | Clean Go build/test caches and verified temporary Go build directories, restore the same Work Item to `Doing`, then rerun the focused gate |
| 2 | Failed | The first D-drive cold-cache build exceeded the 180-second command timeout before producing a test result | Keep the warmed D-drive cache, split focused packages, extend the timeout, restore the same Work Item to `Doing`, and rerun |
| 3 | Failed | `TestInstallPreflightServicePassesWithCompleteImpactSummary` used a base URL without the now-required health URL | Update the fixture to the current paired service contract, add explicit incomplete-pair rejection coverage, restore `Doing`, and rerun |
| 4 | Failed | Existing external-route tests had no health checker, so the new fail-closed gate returned `health_checker_unavailable` | Inject an explicit healthy checker into route-isolation fixtures and add separate real unhealthy/readiness tests before rerunning |
| 5 | Failed | The new health E2E sent GET to a manifest route declared as POST and correctly received HTTP 405 before the health gate | Parameterize the test request method, use POST for business traffic and GET for diagnostics, restore `Doing`, and rerun |
| 6 | Failed | Combined CodeGraph, race, vet, and full-suite command exceeded 360 seconds without yielding per-stage exit codes | Split every final gate into a separate command with its own timeout and evidence, restore `Doing`, and rerun |

Retry status: Go caches were cleaned; subsequent gates use D-drive `GOCACHE` and `GOTMPDIR`; `PR1-02` returned to `Doing`.

## PR1-02 Define And Enforce Plugin Health Contracts

- Date: 2026-07-21
- Owner: Codex
- Status flow: `Todo -> Doing -> Failed -> Doing -> Failed -> Doing -> Failed -> Doing -> Failed -> Doing -> Failed -> Doing -> Review -> Failed -> Doing -> Review -> Done`
- Scope: Add current-format plugin health/readiness contracts, real probes, fail-closed traffic control, diagnostics, bounded caching, and synchronized API documentation.

### Acceptance Result

| Gate | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manifest contract | Pass | `service_base_url` and `service_health_url` must be declared together; incomplete pairs and invalid URLs fail validation |
| Probe policy | Pass | Shared HTTP checker uses unauthenticated GET, a two-second timeout, no redirects, 2xx success, stable failure codes, and bounded response draining |
| Traffic control | Pass | A 503 health response prevents the declared business handler from receiving any request; healthy recovery restores execution |
| Host readiness | Pass | `/ready` returns 503 with `ready=false` while an enabled service plugin is unhealthy and returns 200 after recovery |
| Plugin diagnostics | Pass | `/v1/plugins/{id}/health` reports one plugin with stable 200/404/503 behavior |
| Secret safety | Pass | Reports contain no service URL, query token, network error text, or user credential |
| Performance | Pass | Business requests reuse health results for at most five seconds; explicit diagnostics and readiness refresh them; probe-count assertion prevents per-request probing |
| API contract | Pass | Both OpenAPI copies define readiness/health responses and remain byte-synchronized with resolvable references |
| Quality gates | Pass | Focused tests, race, vet, full Go suite, diff check, and CodeGraph sync pass |

### Verification Commands

```powershell
$env:GOCACHE='D:\.cache\skoll-go'
$env:GOTMPDIR='D:\.tmp\skoll-go'
go test ./internal/plugin ./internal/bootstrap ./internal/handler/http ./internal/handler/http/v1/plugin -count=1
go test -race ./internal/plugin ./internal/bootstrap ./internal/handler/http ./internal/handler/http/v1/plugin -count=1
go vet ./internal/plugin ./internal/bootstrap ./internal/handler/http/...
go test ./... -count=1
codegraph sync .
git diff --check
```

Result: all final gates passed. Six failed attempts were recorded and resolved on the same Work Item before acceptance.

### Impact Review

- API/OpenAPI: `/ready` now exposes structured plugin readiness and may return 503; `GET /v1/plugins/{id}/health` is new; both OpenAPI copies are synchronized.
- Permission/audit: `/ready` remains the bounded public readiness endpoint; single-plugin diagnostics remain behind the existing authenticated plugin-management boundary; no mutation audit is required.
- Migration/seed: no impact.
- Frontend/i18n: no frontend client consumes the diagnostic yet; Chinese-default API messages and English developer reference are complete.
- Documentation: current Chinese and English plugin API contracts define paired service fields, probe, cache, traffic, diagnostics, and error behavior.
- Compatibility: none; incomplete service declarations are rejected under the current contract.
