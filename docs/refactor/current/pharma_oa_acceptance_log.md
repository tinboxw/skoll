git diff --check
```

Result: Passed.

### Next Step

- Claim `F6-01` from `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`.

## F6-01: Implement Theme Engine

- Status: Passed
- Date: 2026-07-04
- Executor: Codex
- Commit: pending

### Changed Files

- `web/src/stores/theme.ts`
- `web/src/main.ts`
- `web/src/App.vue`
- `web/src/components/Layout/Header.vue`
- `web/src/styles/variables.scss`
- `web/src/styles/global.scss`
- `web/src/i18n/index.ts`
- `web/src/plugins/index.ts`
- `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`
- `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_acceptance_log.md`

### Acceptance

| Item | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Theme store | Passed | `useThemeStore` owns `light`, `dark`, and `compact`, persists `skoll.ui.theme`, and applies `data-theme`, `data-theme-mode`, and `data-density` to the root element |
| CSS tokens | Passed | `variables.scss` defines light/dark/compact tokens and Element Plus CSS variable mapping |
| Switch entry | Passed | Header exposes three theme buttons with localized labels and active state |
| Refresh persistence | Passed | Browser smoke kept compact mode after reload |
| Plugin page synchronization | Passed | Existing plugin iframe bridge now injects and posts `skoll:theme` payload with mode, density, color scheme, and tokens |
| Verification | Passed | Typecheck, build, and browser DOM smoke passed |

### Verification Commands

```powershell
cd web; npm run typecheck
cd web; npm run build
cd web; npm run dev
```

Browser smoke result:

```json
{
  "channel": "chrome",
  "hasThemeButtons": 3,
  "initial": { "theme": "light", "mode": "light", "density": "comfortable", "stored": null },
  "dark": { "theme": "dark", "mode": "dark", "density": "comfortable", "stored": "dark" },
  "compact": { "theme": "light", "mode": "compact", "density": "compact", "stored": "compact" },
  "persisted": { "theme": "light", "mode": "compact", "density": "compact", "stored": "compact" }
}
```

Notes:

- `npm run build` still prints the known Sass legacy JS API and VueUse/Rollup annotation warnings, then exits successfully.
- Browser smoke used a temporary local token to enter the frontend shell. Backend `127.0.0.1:8080` was not running, so Vite logged proxy errors for auth/plugin/menu requests; those API calls are outside this Work Item's acceptance scope.

### Next Step

- Claim `F6-02` from `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`.

## F6-02: Implement Plugin UI Kit

- Status: Passed
- Date: 2026-07-04
- Executor: Codex
- Commit: pending

### Changed Files

- `web/src/components/Common/PageShell.vue`
- `web/src/components/Common/PageToolbar.vue`
- `web/src/components/Common/FilterBar.vue`
- `web/src/components/Common/DataTable.vue`
- `web/src/components/Common/DetailDrawer.vue`
- `web/src/components/Common/ConfirmAction.vue`
- `web/src/components/Common/index.ts`
- `web/src/components/Common/README.md`
- `web/src/views/Dashboard/index.vue`
- `web/src/App.vue`
- `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`
- `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_acceptance_log.md`

### Acceptance

| Item | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Page shell | Passed | `PageShell` provides title, description, meta/actions, loading, error, and no-permission states |
| Toolbar and filters | Passed | `PageToolbar` and `FilterBar` provide responsive action/filter layouts |
| Data table | Passed | `DataTable` covers loading, empty, error, no-permission, row actions, custom cells, and pagination slot |
| Detail and confirmation | Passed | `DetailDrawer` covers loading/responsive drawer layout; `ConfirmAction` guards risky actions through Element Plus confirmation |
| Main app usage | Passed | Dashboard now uses `PageShell` and keeps existing cards, quick links, risk states, and permission-aware empty state |
| Responsive smoke | Passed | Dashboard smoke has no overflowing elements at 390px width after retry |
| Documentation | Passed | `web/src/components/Common/README.md` lists UI Kit components, state coverage, usage rules, and validation commands |

### Verification Commands

```powershell
cd web; npm run typecheck
cd web; npm run build
cd web; npm run dev
```

Browser smoke result after retry:

```json
{
  "channel": "chrome",
  "desktop": {
    "hasShell": true,
    "hasHeader": true,
    "cards": 4,
    "statusChips": 2
  },
  "mobile": {
    "bodyWidth": 390,
    "overflowing": []
  }
}
```

### Failure And Retry

- Initial failure: browser smoke found `.content-area` overflowed on 390px width.
- Fix: added `box-sizing: border-box` and `min-width: 0` to `.content-area`.
- Retry result: Passed.

Notes:

- `npm run build` still prints the known Sass legacy JS API and VueUse/Rollup annotation warnings, then exits successfully.
- Browser smoke used a temporary local token to enter the frontend shell. Backend `127.0.0.1:8080` was not running, so Vite logged proxy errors for auth/plugin/menu requests; those API calls are outside this Work Item's acceptance scope.

### Next Step

- Claim `F6-03` from `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`.

## F6-03: Implement Plugin Host SDK

- Status: Passed
- Date: 2026-07-04
- Executor: Codex
- Commit: pending

### Changed Files

- `internal/plugin/host_context.go`
- `internal/plugin/host_context_test.go`
- `web/src/plugins/host-sdk.ts`
- `web/src/plugins/index.ts`
- `web/src/plugins/README.md`
- `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`
- `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_acceptance_log.md`

### Acceptance

| Item | Result | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Backend PluginContext | Passed | `NewPluginContext` exposes plugin identity, API prefix, locale set, issued time, default capabilities, and endpoint contracts |
| Host capabilities | Passed | Context and frontend SDK cover `auth`, `user`, `organization`, `dictionary`, `file`, `audit`, `config`, and `permission` |
| Current API contracts | Passed | SDK and context use existing `/v1/auth/me`, `/v1/system/settings`, `/v1/system/dictionaries`, `/v1/files`, `/v1/audit`, `/v1/plugins/{id}/config`, and `/v1/permissions` paths |
| Frontend injection | Passed | Remote plugin pages and app-home plugin pages receive `window.__SKOLL_HOST__` with the real plugin ID, current locale, token, API prefix, and theme bridge |
| SDK usage sample | Passed | `web/src/plugins/README.md` documents the injected Host SDK and sample calls |
| API/OpenAPI impact | Passed | No new HTTP endpoint was added; OpenAPI remains unchanged because all SDK calls target existing current contracts |
| Permission, audit, migration impact | Passed | No new permission seed, audit action, database table, migration, or seed data is introduced in this Work Item |

### Verification Commands

```powershell
go test ./internal/plugin/...
cd web; npm run typecheck
cd web; npm run build
git diff --check
```

Result: Passed.

Notes:

- `npm run build` still prints the known Sass legacy JS API and VueUse/Rollup annotation warnings, then exits successfully.
- `git diff --check` exits successfully and prints only existing CRLF conversion warnings from the working tree.

### Next Step

- Claim `F6-04` from `docs/refactor/current/pharma_oa_work_items.md`.
